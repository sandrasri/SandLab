# SandLab

The project is called SandLab and it allows the user to add three different elements that simulate sand, water, and an unknown element. Each of the elements moves and interacts differently. SandLab was created in January 2024 as part of Northeastern Universityâ€™s CS 2510: Fundamentals of Computer Science 2. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to add the three elements by clicking in the window. The user can also remove any of the elements using the erase button. Additionally, the user can change the speed at which the pixels are moving or interacting with a slider at the bottom of the window.
